      Masters on [Tethered Aerial Vehicles for Remote Soil Moisture Sensing Applications](https://profiles.canterbury.ac.nz/Christopher-Hann/teaching)
      - Developed and tested low-cost tethered balloon and UAV systems for remote soil moisture monitoring.
      - Created a minimal model of a tethered balloon to study wind effects; validated experimentally up to 48-hour operation.
      - Designed a Power-over-Tether system for UAVs, enabling extended hover times without batteries.
      - Implemented camera-based soil health monitoring, comparing multispectral and RGB cameras; RGB proved more practical and reliable.
      - Developed georeferencing algorithms to accurately locate areas of dead or bare grass (~2 m error).
      - Gained hands-on experience in platform design, sensor integration, data collection, and analysis under real-world conditions.

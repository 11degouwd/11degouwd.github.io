# I approach problems with methodical reasoning and strong visualisation, building clear mental models of systems to reason through real-world behaviour, interactions, and edge cases.
content: |-
  I specialize in electronics and systems engineering, helping companies take complex projects from concept to deployment. 
  With a background in mechatronics, I work comfortably across electronics, software, and mechanical domains, often owning systems end-to-end rather than isolated components.

  My core experience includes lithium battery pack design, solar and energy systems, embedded development, and PCB design — experience I’ve applied across aerospace and robotics platforms.

  I use methodical reasoning and strong visualisation to build accurate mental models of systems, helping me anticipate interactions, constraints, and failure modes early in the design process.
